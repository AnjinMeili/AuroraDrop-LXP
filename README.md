# AuroraDrop v0.1

RGB Matrix Audio Visualiser for ESP32

Introduction

Welcome. Work is in progress, updates may appear now and then.


Notes:

AuroraDrop's audio visualisaions currently only work when your ESP32 is connected to your PC via the USB connection,
and you are running the companion windows application 'AuroraDrop Companion'. The application captures and processes
the current audio playing on your PC and passes this to the ESP32 via serial communications, which then renders the
visualisations.
